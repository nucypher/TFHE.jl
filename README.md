# TFHE

Master branch: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nucypher/TFHE.jl.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nucypher/TFHE.jl) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/nucypher/TFHE.jl/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/nucypher/TFHE.jl)

A Julia port of:

* TFHE (https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe), based on I. Chillotti, N. Gama, M. Georgieva, and M. Izabach√®ne, "Faster Fully Homomorphic Encryption: Bootstrapping in Less Than 0.1 Seconds";
* MKFTHE (https://github.com/ilachill/MK-TFHE), based on H. Chen, I. Chillotti, and Y. Song, "Multi-Key Homomophic Encryption from TFHE".

The implementation is focused primarily on clarity and conciseness, not on performance.
